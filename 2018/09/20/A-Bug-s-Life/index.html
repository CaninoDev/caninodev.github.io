This doesn’t detract from her all around badassery however. I highly encourage learning about her. She significantly accelerated the development of programming languages with her significant contribution to COBOL (a langugage still used today!), been described “as appearing to be all Navy, but when you reach inside, you find a ‘Pirate’ dying to be released”, and famously said: “It’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission. (and its variant: “If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.”).</p>

<p>“If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.” - Confucius, The Analects of Confucius<br>In fact, the term ‘bugs’ and ‘debugging’ were commonly used at the time among engineering circles. In fact, originally <em>bugge</em> meant “something frightening; scarecrow.” and only just transformed its meaning during the 1870’s. Thomas Edison (NIKOLA TESLA RULES!) wrote:<br>It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise - this thing gives out and [it is] then that “Bugs” - as such little faults and difficulties are called - show themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached.<br>Among certain, - -ahem - - hipster engineering circles, ‘bugs’ are further redefined as ‘mistake metamorphisms’.<br>Software bugs are the cause of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars Climate Orbiter</a>‘s disintegration in Mar’s atmosphere (we really all should just get on the metric unit), the destruction of the alien mothership in Independence Day, and most importantly (and my personal favorite) a bug in Sid Meier’s Civilization that would cause the normally peaceful Ghandhi to become the most agressive civilization leader in the game.<br>After scouring Stack Exchange (and their numerous forums), industry articles covering computer science, the consensus is that beyond simple Hello_World programs, <strong>software bugs are pretty much a certainty.</strong> (Except when it is a feature.)<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/88JWeQQ.png" alt="image"><br> - - - - - -</p>

It came down to the principle of Emergence. Many of the postings and articles I have read eventually pointed to <a href="http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.<br><img src="http://www.jakubkonka.com/images/gof.gif" alt="image"><br>This game has 4 basic rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Conways_game_of_life_breeder_animation.gif" alt="image"><br>Depending on starting conditions, the system has properties that its parts do not have. This game is in a perfect system, thus unanticipated patterns repeat indefinitely.<br>However, software never exists in isolation and do not always produce intended behavior. It is a part of a digital ecology of imperfect actors with partially realized intentions. Interactions are thus unpredictable and sometime with drastic outcomes.
